I joined the Data Analyst course of Udacity. And this project is the Test project "Analyze A/B Test Results" of "Part 3: Practical Statistics".

I have performed data gathering, assessment, and data clean up, performed hypothesis testing, and drew conclusions based on my understanding by using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new web page or keep the old one.
